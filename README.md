# contestlib

Collection of algorithm implementations for programming contests

Main purpose of conteslib is to be team reference document for ICPC contests. The team reference document is src.pdf. The files that are included in team reference document begin with // TCR. 

The code is generally ugly because of 25 page limit in the team reference document.
