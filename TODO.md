#TODO

* More compact code

##Geometry:
* Welzl's algorithm for minimum enclosing circle
* Triangulation

##Strings:
* Palindromic tree xD

##Graphs:
* How to implement ford fulkerson/scaling flow? Flow matrix requires O(n^2) space or O(log n) extra time but the answer is usually easier to reconstruct from it than from the edge representation.
* Hungarian algorithm
* General matching
* Min cost arborescence
* Gomory-Hu tree

##Data structure
* Some complicated segment tree implementation
* The simple O(n) convex hull trick

##Math
* Discrete root http://e-maxx-eng.github.io/algebra/discrete-root.html
* Numerical integration

##Test:
* Tangents of convex hulls
* Half plane intersection
* Performance of simplex and write something about it

##Other:
* Math formulas?
* TODO lists for practice session and debugging
