#TODO

* More compact code

##Geometry:

##Strings:

##Graphs:
* How to implement ford fulkerson/scaling flow? Flow matrix requires O(n^2) space or O(log n) extra time but the answer is usually easier to reconstruct from it than from the edge representation.
* Offline dynamic connectivity could be removed from tcr since it is easy to implement and you have to modify the implementation for most of the applications anyway.
* Hungarian algorithm

##Number theory:
* Discrete root http://e-maxx-eng.github.io/algebra/discrete-root.html

##Numeric:
* Numerical integration

##Test:
* Tangents of convex hulls
* Half plane intersection

##Other:
* Math formulas?
